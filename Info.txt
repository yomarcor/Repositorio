AngularJS is an open source library. It is based on Javascript and helps you build Single Page applications. 
In this lesson, we are going to create a page that displays the list of employees, and allows you to add, delete, and edit employees.

The issues that will be mentioned in this lesson:
1) Create a Spring Boot application.
2) Create REST APIs with the  functions:  Querying, creating, editing, deleting data
3) AngularJS calls REST APIs to query data and display the data on  the interface. 
   AngularJS calls the REST APIs to create, delete, and edit the data.
